# Domain Search Using GoDaddy API

This Ruby Gem will search GoDaddy.com for website domain availability and pricing using the GoDaddy Developer API.  You can search for a specific domain name or get a list of domains related to any keyword.  If you search for a specific domain and it is not available for purchase, a list of similar domain names will automatically appear.

Note that you cannot make purchases directly from this Gem, but you can purchase available domains directly on the GoDaddy website.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'domain_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install domain_project
